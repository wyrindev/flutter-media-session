## 2.2.0
* **Professional Adapter Architecture**: Introduced `MediaSessionAdapter` interface to completely decouple player implementations from system-level media session controls.
* **Copy-Ready Player Adapters**: Provided standalone, copy-ready adapter classes for `just_audio` and `media_kit` in `doc/adapters/` and the official wiki documentation, keeping the core package completely free of third-party player dependencies.
* **Lifecycle Modernization**: Clear lifecycle state management (`Idle` -> `Active` -> `Bound` -> `Unbound` -> `Deactivated`).
* **Naming Standardization**: Renamed `setHandlesInterruptions` to `setAutoHandleInterruptions` full-stack across platform interfaces, Android, Windows, and Dart layers for improved API clarity.
* **Windows SMTC Refinements**:
  * **Visual Flashing Fix**: Added metadata deduplication caching in C++ to prevent cover art/thumbnail flashing on progress/playback state changes.
  * **Shuffle/Repeat Sync Fix**: Implemented robust type parsing (`bool`, `int32_t`, `int64_t`) and synchronous feedback in WinRT callbacks to prevent button states from resetting or locking to "Closed" in the OS UI.
* **Darwin Package Manager Fix**: Updated Swift package configuration (`Package.swift`) to correctly declare the `FlutterFramework` dependency, resolving iOS/macOS compiler warnings.
* **Deprecations**: Marked legacy manual sync APIs (`updateMetadata`, `updatePlaybackState`, `updateAvailableActions`, `onMediaAction`) as deprecated. Scheduled for removal in `3.0.0`.



## 2.1.3
* **New Actions**: Added `MediaAction.shuffle` and `MediaAction.repeat` for native shuffle and repeat toggles.
* **Windows Improvements**: 
    * Enhanced artwork handling for local file paths (converting to `file://` URIs).
    * Improved timeline synchronization to prevent progress bar drift in system controls.
    * Added support for native Shuffle and Repeat buttons in the System Media Transport Controls (SMTC).
    * Added robust safety checks and error handling for SMTC updates.
* **Android Improvements**: Refined custom action rendering and fixed potential slider rendering issues.
* **Example App**: Modularized UI components and implemented a "ping-pong" player strategy for smoother track transitions on Windows.

## 2.1.2
* Fixed version number in README to match the actual release version

## 2.1.1
* Fixed version number in README to match the actual release version

## 2.1.0

* **Android Custom Media Actions**: Added support for adding custom buttons (like "Like", "Shuffle") to the system notification and lock screen controls via Media3.
    * Extended `MediaAction` to support custom labels and Android drawable resources.
    * Improved Android `MediaSessionService` to dynamically update custom layout commands.
    * **Security**: Implemented robust input validation and size-limited caching for custom action parameters and controller commands.
* **Audio Focus Management**: Added `setHandlesInterruptions(bool)` to opt-in to automatic audio focus handling on Android. This allows the plugin to automatically pause/resume playback during calls or other audio interruptions.
* **iOS & macOS Support**: Added full support for Darwin platforms using `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` and `MPRemoteCommandCenter`.
* **Windows Improvements**: 
    * Resolved the "Unknown Application" issue in system media controls using dynamic AppUserModelID (AUMID) registration and Start Menu shortcut creation.
    * Improved COM lifecycle management and path traversal security in Windows implementation.
* **Fixes & Improvements**:
    * **Android**: Exposed playback state via accessor for better integration with custom services (PR #16).
    * **Example**: Fixed a `Slider` rendering assertion failure when durations were zero or negative.
    * **Web**: Improved `updateAvailableActions` parity.
* Updated documentation and example app to demonstrate new platform features.

## 2.0.0

* Added `updateAvailableActions` API to dynamically toggle system media controls (Play, Pause, Skip, Seek, etc.).
* Improved Web Media Session playback buffering and synchronized seeking logic.
* Fixed Android and Windows media progress bar synchronization, with advanced position extrapolation.
* Enhanced debounced seeking strategy across all platforms.
* Improved documentation and fixed cross-platform link consistency.

## 1.0.0

* Initial release of `flutter_media_session`.
* Support for Android (Media3), Windows (SMTC), and Web (Media Session API).
* Synchronize track metadata (title, artist, album, artwork).
* Synchronize playback states (playing, paused, position, speed).
* Receive media actions (play, pause, next, previous) from system controls.
